## Description
This repository contains the dataset created and used for the REDUNET scientific paper.  
Source code is available on request.

The dataset is composed by 10 different projects. For each of these, the following elements are provided:  
- *randoop-tests.zip*: the junit tests generated with the Randoop tool  
- *covered_methods.txt*: the list of methods covered by the given test. It is used to shorten the node labels both in graph and traces)  
- *cfg.txt*: the control flow graph of the given project (using intra-procedural dependences)  
- *traces.txt*: the file containing the execution traces for all the given tests (covered lines and test execution time in ms)  
- *repository.txt*: file containing the references to the project repository (on github) and the exact version (commit) considered  

A script to download the source code for all of the cosidered projects from github is also provided.
